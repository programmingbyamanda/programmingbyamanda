# Programming by Amanda

HELLO! Welcome to my GitHub page! 

My name is Amanda and I love to code! I hold a Bachelor of Science degree from Radford University (in Southwest Virginia) and completed my clinical internship at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center.  While I began a rewarding career as a Clinician, I decided to make a career change in 2017.  Since then, I have been learning C#, .NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Android App Development, Java, Python, Unity, SSRS reports, EPICOR BAQs and Dashboards, and so much more! I am capable of Full-Stack Development, developing SSRS reports, writing queries, and Front-end development, as well! I am learning how to create my own sticker packs for imessage, right now! I have learned to collaborate on GitHub and understand the Linux-based Git commands.  I have built webpages for friends from the ground up (in Visual Studio IDE) and in Wordpress. In October 2019, I began working in a large-scale company, where I am thankful to have grown my skill set. I  developed .aspx pages, wrote back-end code in C#, and developed SSRS reports.  

I have a concrete understanding of methodology, design specifications, and programming concepts.  I thrive in an environment with autonomy, where collaboration is encouraged.  I desire to be a part of a team who values curiosity, learning, growth, efficiency, and quality.  I am always eager to learn more code! 

I would love to speak with you about your software development or web development needs!
